/*
 * The Scheduler Driver is responsible for managing the scheduler's
 * lifecycle (e.g., start, stop, or wait to finish) and interacting
 * with Mesos Master (e.g., launch tasks, kill tasks, etc.).
 * Note that this interface is usually not implemented by a framework
 * itself, but it describes the possible calls a framework scheduler
 * can make to interact with the Mesos Master. Please note that usage
 * of this interface requires an instantiated MesosSchedulerDiver.
 *
 * - Starts the scheduler driver. This needs to be called before any
 *   other driver calls are made.
 *
 *   virtual Status start();
 *
 * - Stops the scheduler driver. If the 'failover' flag is set to
 *  false then it is expected that this framework will never
 *  reconnect to Mesos. So Mesos will unregister the framework and
 *  shutdown all its tasks and executors. If 'failover' is true, all
 *  executors and tasks will remain running (for some framework
 *  specific failover timeout) allowing the scheduler to reconnect
 *  (possibly in the same process, or from a different process, for
 *  example, on a different machine).
 *
 *  virtual Status stop(bool failover = false);
 *
 * - Aborts the driver so that no more callbacks can be made to the
 *  scheduler. The semantics of abort and stop have deliberately been
 *  separated so that code can detect an aborted driver (i.e., via
 *  the return status of SchedulerDriver::join, see below), and
 *  instantiate and start another driver if desired (from within the
 *  same process). Note that 'stop()' is not automatically called
 *  inside 'abort()'.
 *
 *  virtual Status abort();
 *
 * - Waits for the driver to be stopped or aborted, possibly
 *  _blocking_ the current thread indefinitely. The return status of
 *  this function can be used to determine if the driver was aborted
 *  (see mesos.proto for a description of Status).
 *
 *  virtual Status join();
 *
 * - Starts and immediately joins (i.e., blocks on) the driver.
 *
 *  virtual Status run();
 *
 * - Requests resources from Mesos (see mesos.proto for a description
 *  of Request and how, for example, to request resources from
 *  specific slaves). Any resources available are offered to the
 *  framework via Scheduler::resourceOffers callback, asynchronously.
 *
 *  virtual Status requestResources(const std::vector<Request>& requests);
 *
 * - Launches the given set of tasks. Any remaining resources (i.e.,
 *  those that are not used by the launched tasks or their executors)
 *  will be considered declined. Note that this includes resources
 *  used by tasks that the framework attempted to launch but failed
 *  (with `TASK_ERROR`) due to a malformed task description. The
 *  specified filters are applied on all unused resources (see
 *  mesos.proto for a description of Filters). Available resources
 *  are aggregated when multiple offers are provided. Note that all
 *  offers must belong to the same slave. Invoking this function with
 *  an empty collection of tasks declines offers in their entirety
 *  (see Scheduler::declineOffer).
 *
 *  virtual Status launchTasks(
 *    const std::vector<OfferID>& offerIds,
 *    const std::vector<TaskInfo>& tasks,
 *    const Filters& filters = Filters());
 *
 * - Kills the specified task. Note that attempting to kill a task is
 *  currently not reliable. If, for example, a scheduler fails over
 *  while it was attempting to kill a task it will need to retry in
 *  the future. Likewise, if unregistered / disconnected, the request
 *  will be dropped (these semantics may be changed in the future).
 *
 *  virtual Status killTask(const TaskID& taskId);
 *
 * - Accepts the given offers and performs a sequence of operations on
 *  those accepted offers. See Offer.Operation in mesos.proto for the
 *  set of available operations. Any remaining resources (i.e., those
 *  that are not used by the launched tasks or their executors) will
 *  be considered declined. Note that this includes resources used by
 *  tasks that the framework attempted to launch but failed (with
 *  `TASK_ERROR`) due to a malformed task description. The specified
 *  filters are applied on all unused resources (see mesos.proto for
 *  a description of Filters). Available resources are aggregated
 *  when multiple offers are provided. Note that all offers must
 *  belong to the same slave.
 *
 *  virtual Status acceptOffers(
 *    const std::vector<OfferID>& offerIds,
 *    const std::vector<Offer::Operation>& operations,
 *    const Filters& filters = Filters());
 *
 * - Declines an offer in its entirety and applies the specified
 *   filters on the resources (see mesos.proto for a description of
 *   Filters). Note that this can be done at any time, it is not
 *   necessary to do this within the Scheduler::resourceOffers
 *   callback.
 *
 *  virtual Status declineOffer(
 *    const OfferID& offerId,
 *    const Filters& filters = Filters());
 *
 * - Removes all filters previously set by the framework (via
 *   launchTasks()). This enables the framework to receive offers from
 *   those filtered slaves.
 8
 *  virtual Status reviveOffers();
 *
 * - Inform Mesos master to stop sending offers to the framework. The
 *   scheduler should call reviveOffers() to resume getting offers.
 *
 *  virtual Status suppressOffers();
 *
 * - Acknowledges the status update. This should only be called
 *   once the status update is processed durably by the scheduler.
 *   Not that explicit acknowledgements must be requested via the
 *   constructor argument, otherwise a call to this method will
 *   cause the driver to crash.
 *
 *  virtual Status acknowledgeStatusUpdate(const TaskStatus& status);
 *
 * - Sends a message from the framework to one of its executors. These
 *   messages are best effort; do not expect a framework message to be
 *   retransmitted in any reliable fashion.
 *
 *  virtual Status sendFrameworkMessage(
 *    const ExecutorID& executorId,
 *    const SlaveID& slaveId,
 *    const std::string& data);
 *
 * - Allows the framework to query the status for non-terminal tasks.
 *   This causes the master to send back the latest task status for
 *   each task in 'statuses', if possible. Tasks that are no longer
 *   known will result in a TASK_LOST update. If statuses is empty,
 *   then the master will send the latest status for each task
 *   currently known.
 *
 *  virtual Status reconcileTasks(const std::vector<TaskStatus>& statuses);
